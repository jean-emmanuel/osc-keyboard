*This is a proof of concept, not a curated project.*

Requirements:

- nodejs
- java run time

Usage:

```
# install
git clone https://github.com/jean-emmanuel/osc-keyboard
cd osc-keyboard
npm install

# run
npm start
```

With the default config, sending `/keys alt tab` (one argument per key) on port `5555` should work.
